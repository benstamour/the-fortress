The Fortress
===========

This project is a 3D dungeon platformer made in Unity and my second game creation since graduating university. In this game, the player must navigate a series of deadly obstacles in order to get to the end, with the optional additional challenge of collecting each of the six coloured orbs placed along the player's route. The goal is to make it to the end as fast as possible!

To expand from my first game (**[The Dungeon](https://github.com/benstamour/dungeon-game)**), I worked with more intricate obstacles and triggers, and I added a save point feature, which gives players the option to respawn at the last save point they reach instead of having to start over at the beginning. I also experimented with different lighting types and placements.

I designed and created the fortress arena using assets from the Unity Asset Store, and I also worked with scripting, GUI, animations, textures, audio, lighting, and editing 3D models (sculpting, posing, modifying vertices, and arranging scenes). To play the game, you can download the .zip file for the build using **[this link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1caRaY3NPnzcP0SjwonTBmYagXsfTuZnR)** and run `The Fortress.exe`. You can also check out **[this page](https://bensta.epizy.com/fortress/)** to see some images of the game along with a list of assets used in the final build and links to the sources.
